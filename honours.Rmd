## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

libraries I might need
```{r}
library(patchclampplotteR)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggsignif)
library(ggtext)
library(ggforce)
library(ggpubr)
library(here)
```
Importing Cell Characteristics
```{r}
cell_characteristics <- import_cell_characteristics_df("Data/Cell-Characteristics.csv")

cell_characteristics
```

Importing NEW Raw Evoked Current Data
```{r eval=FALSE}
eEPSC_data <- read.csv("Data/new_raw.csv")

eEPSC_data
```

Merging Raw Evoked Current Data with Cell Characteristics FOR THE FIRST TIME
```{r eval=FALSE}
first_time_df <- add_new_cells(
  new_raw_data_csv = "Data/new_raw.csv", #eEPSC raw data just imported
  cell_characteristics_csv = "Data/Cell-Characteristics.csv", #just imported
  old_raw_data_csv = "Data/merged.csv", #blank except for letter
  data_type = "eEPSC",
  # files merged without any issue, now going to change it to yes for write_new_csv
  write_new_csv = "yes",
  new_file_name = "Data/raw_eEPSC_df.csv",
  decimal_places = 2
)
# successfully made new document where all the merged data will live from now on, making this chunk not run again since it will never be the first time for this project again
```
To Append New Data onto the EXISTING SHEET (raw_eEPSC_df.csv) after first time
```{r eval=FALSE}
# will not run if there is nothing new in "new_raw.csv" so if you put new data directly into "raw_eEPSC_df.csv", it won't run
add_new_cells(
  new_raw_data_csv = "Data/new_raw.csv", # should ONLY have the new data you want
  cell_characteristics_csv = "Data/Cell-Characteristics.csv",
  old_raw_data_csv = "Data/raw_eEPSC_df.csv",
  data_type = "eEPSC",
  write_new_csv = "yes",
  new_file_name = "Data/raw_eEPSC_df.csv", # will overwrite the current version of this file
  decimal_places = 2
)

#once successful, go delete the data from "new_raw.csv" so that you don't get a duplication error the next time you are adding data to the raw_eEPSC_df.
```
Look at the data frame
```{r}
raw_eEPSC_df <- read.csv(here("Data/raw_eEPSC_df.csv")) #puts it in the environment

raw_eEPSC_df #prints it
```
